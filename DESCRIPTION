Description:
    Modern model-based geostatistics for point-referenced data. This package provides a
    simple interface to run spatial machine learning models and geostatistical models
    that estimate a continuous (raster) surface from point-referenced outcomes and,
    optionally, a set of raster covariates. The package also includes functions to
    summarize raster outcomes by (polygon) region while preserving uncertainty.
