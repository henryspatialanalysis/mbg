\usage{
prepare_inla_data_stack(
  input_data,
  id_raster,
  covariates,
  spde_range_pc_prior = list(threshold = 0.1, prob_below = 0.05),
  spde_sigma_pc_prior = list(threshold = 3, prob_above = 0.05),
  sum_to_one = FALSE,
  mesh_max_edge = c(0.2, 5),
  mesh_cutoff = 0.04
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_data}{A data.frame with at least the following columns:
\itemize{
\item 'indicator': number of "hits' per site, e.g. tested positive for malaria
\item 'samplesize': total population sampled at the site
\item 'x': x position, often longitude
\item 'y': y position, often latitude
}}

\item{id_raster}{terra SpatRaster with non-NA pixels delineating the extent of the
study area}

\item{covariates}{(list) Named list of all covariate effects included in the model,
typically generated by \code{\link[=load_covariates]{load_covariates()}}.}

\item{spde_range_pc_prior}{(list) A named list specifying the penalized complexity
prior for the SPDE range. The two named items are "threshold", the test threshold
(set as a proportion of the overall mesh extent), and "prob_below", the prior
probability that the value is BELOW that range threshold. The function automatically
converts "threshold" from a proportion of the overall mesh extent into a distance.}

\item{spde_sigma_pc_prior}{(list) A named list specifying the penalized complexity
prior for sigma (standard deviation) of the SPDE object. The two named items are
"threshold", the test threshold for the standard deviation, and "prob_above",
the prior probability that sigma will EXCEED that threshold.}

\item{sum_to_one}{(logical, default FALSE) Should the input covariates be constrained
to sum to one? Usually FALSE when raw covariates are passed to the model, and TRUE
if running an ensemble ('stacking') model.}

\item{mesh_max_edge}{(\code{numeric(2)}, default c(0.2, 5)) Maximum size of the INLA mesh
inside (1) and outside (2) of the region.}

\item{mesh_cutoff}{(\code{numeric(1)}, default 0.04) Minimum size of the INLA mesh, usually
reached in data-dense areas.}
}
\value{
List containing the following items:
\itemize{
\item "mesh": The mesh used to approximate the latent Gaussian process
\item "spde": The SPDE object that will be used to fit the INLA model
\item "inla_data_stack": The data stack to be passed to \code{INLA::inla()}
\item "formula_string": The formula specification to be passed to \code{INLA::inla()}
}
